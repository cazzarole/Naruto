# Values = giving value to a variable as well as number value eg. 2 
# Variables = cannot start with number. eg, car = 2

# Evalute = adding two numbers and getting one single result in maths 
# Functions such as str(), int(), len() and float()
# The length function sums up the characters in the line.
