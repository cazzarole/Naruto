# On this script I will talk about Naruto, the main characters in the show and how long it is.

# Values = giving value to a variable as well as number value eg. 2 
# Variables = cannot start with number. eg, car = 2  
# Operators = math operators +, - , /, //, *, **: string operators: *, +
# Evalute = adding two numbers and getting one single result in maths 
# Functions such as str(), int(), len() and float()
# The length function sums up the characters in the line.

# We have moved on to the next chapter which is flow control. Here its working with Booleans, True and False

# == Equal to

# < Less than
# > Greater than
# <= Less than or equal to
# >= Greater than or equal to
# The == and != operators can actually work with values of any data type

# Using flow control, we will use dilaong - grouping code tha gets executed multiple times
# "you just gotta belive it,", end= " " or sep=','= disable the newline that gets added to the end of every print() function call. or separates strings
